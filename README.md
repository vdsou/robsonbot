### Hey, there! 
#### Robson can do so many things that I can't even describe, but I'll try.

This project is about <b>Robson</b>, a discord bot who can do some simple things,
but very necessary for me and my friends over my particular discord server.
#### He can:
- Play fun audios;
- Show a scoreboard;
- Say some cool and fun messages on text channel;
- Show some cute kitty cat images.

Most of the commands are stored in a MongoDB database.
He's also an <b>API</b> whose endpoints are currently being consumed by his own webpage
made with love <3 by me.
